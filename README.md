### How to build

To build the library you need to clone the repository of CLI11 (using `git clone "repo link"`) into the dependencies folder and then copy the relevant header files into the external/include/ folder. The makefile already has that folder listed in the includes so you should be freely able to include the headers in the code.
For Vince's CSV Parser, repeat the steps but copy the single include "csv.hpp" header file.
Do the same for the Howard Hinnant's date library, but copy the "date" folder from /include/ into the /external/include/ folder in the project.
To install the fmt library, you have to clone its repository to the dependencies folder. Then, you need to create a directory inside the build folder with the name of the library and change into it. From there you need to run `cmake ../../dependencies/fmt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../external`, where external/ is the external directory within the root folder of the project. Afterwards, you need to run `make`, and then `make install`. The Makefile already has everything needed for the library to work, so you are free to use it in the code now.
